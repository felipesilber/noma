# Wireframe

## What is a Wireframe?

Wireframes are fundamental design tools used in the early stages of digital product development. In this context, they serve as simplified, low-fidelity visual representations of a user interface, focusing primarily on structure, layout, and functionality rather than on detailed aesthetics or final content.

By using wireframes, designers, developers, and stakeholders can align on the foundational elements of an application or website before investing time and resources into high-fidelity design and development. Furthermore, wireframes facilitate early feedback and iteration, which are essential in ensuring a user-centered and goal-driven design process.

The primary purposes of wireframing include:

- **Visualizing Layout**: Wireframes provide a clear blueprint of how elements such as menus, buttons, content blocks, and navigation flows will be arranged on each screen.
- **Clarifying Functionality**: They help define the behavior and interaction of different components, allowing teams to discuss user journeys and technical requirements.
- **Improving Communication**: Wireframes act as a common reference point between designers, developers, product managers, and clients, minimizing misunderstandings and aligning expectations.
- **Enabling Early Testing**: Through wireframes, usability can be tested and improved even before visual design begins, ensuring that user needs are met from the start.

In conclusion, wireframes are indispensable in the digital design process. They promote strategic thinking, reduce risks, and lay a solid foundation for building intuitive, effective, and user-friendly digital products.

## Project wireframe Scope and Purpose

This wireframe aims to represent the core features and user flow of a mobile application for the solution. Through a series of low-fidelity screens, it outlines the main interactions and structural layout of the app, allowing for early validation and feedback before advancing to high-fidelity design or development.

The wireframe covers the following key components:

- **Login Screen**: Establishes a secure and simple entry point for users to access their accounts.
- **Home Screen**: Displays popular venues, nearby recommendations, and curated lists to facilitate discovery.
- **Search Functionality**: Enables users to search for places using either text or an interactive map, supporting both targeted queries and exploratory browsing.
- **Review Submission**: Allows users to add their own ratings, comments, and photos, contributing to the community’s content and insights.
- **Ranking Page**: Highlights top-rated places based on user reviews and activity, encouraging exploration and engagement.
- **Profile Page**: Serves as the user’s personal space, showing their reviews, saved places, created lists, and account details.

By focusing on these essential features, the wireframe provides a clear vision of the app's structure and intended user experience. It helps ensure that the design remains aligned with the app's purpose: to create a social, user-driven platform for discovering the best local spots.
