Porter's Five Forces is a framework developed by Michael Porter that helps analyze the competitive dynamics of an industry. It evaluates five key factors that determine the competitive intensity and profitability potential within a market.

### **Purpose of Porter's Five Forces**
1. **Threat of New Entrants** – How easy is it for new competitors to enter the market?  
2. **Bargaining Power of Buyers** – How much influence do customers have over prices and product offerings?  
3. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** – How much control do suppliers have over the business's costs and inputs?  
4. **Threat of Substitute Products or Services** – How easily can customers switch to a different solution?  
5. **Industry Rivalry** – How intense is the competition within the market?
