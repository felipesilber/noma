# Risk Matrix

## Introduction
A **Risk Matrix** is a strategic tool used to identify, assess, and manage potential risks that may affect the success of a project. It helps to classify risks based on their **probability of occurrence** and **impact** on the business, allowing for better strategic planning and mitigation strategies.

### **Purpose of a Risk Matrix**
- **Identify** the most critical risks that could compromise the project.  
- **Evaluate** the probability and impact of each risk.  
- **Prepare** contingency plans and risk mitigation strategies.

## **Risk Matrix**
| **Risk** | **Probability** | **Impact** | **Explanation** |
|----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Low user adoption at launch** | High | High | Since the platform is a social network, its value proposition depends on having a minimum user base for the recommendation system and network effect to function effectively. Failure to attract early users could compromise the platform's success. |
| **Competition from established platforms** | High | High | Platforms like **TripAdvisor**, **Google Reviews**, and **The Fork** already have a strong user base and established market presence. A new platform will face resistance when trying to gain market share. |
| **Lack of engagement from establishments** | Medium | High | For the recommendation and promotion system to work effectively, bars and restaurants need to see value in the data generated by the platform. A lack of engagement from businesses will limit the platform's usefulness and value. |
| **Challenges in initial monetization** | High | High | During the initial phase, it may be difficult to generate revenue without compromising the user experience. A lack of a sustainable revenue model could affect long-term growth and viability. |
| **Balancing with other commitments by the founder** | Medium | High | During 2025, balancing an internship and the development of the project will require strong organization and realistic planning. Issues in managing these responsibilities could affect the quality of the MVP. |
| **Technical issues and bugs after launch** | High | Medium | After launching the MVP, technical issues such as functional bugs and failures in the recommendation algorithm are likely to occur, which could negatively impact the user experience. |
| **Lack of capital for initial investment** | Low | Medium | Depending on the robustness and quality expected for the MVP, a greater need for initial investment may arise. The available capital must be carefully planned and aligned with current financial realities. |
| **Lack of workforce** | High | High | Having a development team limited to one person may restrict delivery times and the quality of the MVP. Therefore, the project schedule defined during Sprint 1 should be strictly followed. |
| **Leakage of sensitive data** | Medium | High | Since the platform will store sensitive data (e.g., location, user preferences), data leaks or security failures could severely damage the platform’s reputation and lead to legal penalties. |

## **Key Takeaways**
- The most critical risks are **low user adoption**, **strong competition**, and **limited workforce**, which could threaten the viability of the platform.  
- **Challenges in monetization** and **engagement from businesses** will directly affect the platform’s ability to scale and sustain itself.  
- Potential technical failures and **data security issues** represent operational and reputational risks that need to be carefully managed.  
- The project's dependency on a **single developer** and the need to balance it with an internship adds complexity to the execution and delivery of the MVP.
