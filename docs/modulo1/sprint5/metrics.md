# Success Metrics (KPIs)

## Introduction

In innovation projects and new product development, defining and tracking success metrics — or KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) — become central elements to ensure effective management based on data. Metrics are quantitative or qualitative indicators that measure the performance of processes, products, and strategies in relation to previously established objectives. In this way, they serve as guiding tools, providing a clear view of what is working, what needs adjustment, and how resources are being utilized.

In the context of developing a new solution, the role of metrics is even more relevant, as they not only guide the progress of the initiative in its different phases but also provide support for strategic decisions, such as the need for pivoting, adjustments to the business model, or technical reconfigurations. Through systematic KPI analysis, it is possible to reduce uncertainties, anticipate risks, and validate market hypotheses, providing greater security both for the development team and potential investors and partners. In this way, well-defined and correctly interpreted metrics become important competitive differentiators in high volatility and constant innovation environments.

## Metrics in Solution Development

In the project, the definition of success metrics was organized into four main categories, ranging from technical aspects to monetization and growth factors. This division was made to ensure a holistic approach, covering both the robustness of the technological infrastructure and user behavior, as well as the platform's financial sustainability. Each category has its own characteristics and plays an essential role in building an integrated view of the product's performance over time.

The first category refers to technical metrics, whose goal is to monitor system efficiency, reliability, and stability. Next, we address launch and growth metrics, which are critical for measuring the platform's initial traction and user acquisition rate. Engagement metrics focus on evaluating the quality of user interaction with the product, reflecting the perceived interest and utility. Finally, monetization metrics seek to measure the platform's ability to generate revenue and make its business model viable, ensuring its economic sustainability in the medium and long term.

## Metrics by Category

### Technical

Technical metrics are essential to ensure the stability, performance, and reliability of the platform. Each indicator was carefully selected to monitor critical aspects of the infrastructure and user experience.

- **Response Time:** measures the average time the system takes to respond to user requests. The established goal is to maintain the response time below 300 milliseconds, ensuring smooth and efficient navigation.

- **Uptime (Server Availability):** refers to the percentage of time the system remains operational without interruptions. To ensure user trust, the goal is to achieve 99.9% uptime.

- **Crash Rate:** evaluates the number of failures that cause the app to crash in relation to the total number of sessions. The project aims to keep the crash rate below 1% to provide a stable experience.

- **Average Load Time:** indicates how long it takes, on average, to load a page or functionality in the app. The goal is to ensure a load time of less than 2 seconds.

- **% of API Failures:** tracks the percentage of API calls that result in errors. The project seeks to keep the API failure rate below 0.5%, ensuring the integrity of communication between systems.

- **MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures):** represents the average time between failures, an indicator of system robustness. The expectation is that MTBF will exceed 30 days, demonstrating high reliability.

- **MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery):** refers to the average time to recover after a failure. The goal is for MTTR not to exceed 2 hours, ensuring quick problem resolution.

### Launch and Growth

Launch and growth metrics are indispensable for monitoring the initial acceptance of the product, measuring the evolution of the user base, and identifying potential bottlenecks in user acquisition and retention strategies.

- **New Users per Time (Week/Month):** monitors the number of new registrations in the app.

- **Retention at 1, 7, and 30 Days:** evaluates the percentage of users who continue using the platform after these periods.

- **Weekly/Monthly Engagement:** measures the frequency of active users during a given time period.

- **User Churn:** refers to the rate of users who abandon the platform during a given period. The target is to keep monthly churn below 5%, demonstrating good acceptance and perceived value by users.

### Engagement

Engagement metrics are crucial to understanding user behavior within the platform, as well as fostering an active and participatory community.

- **Number of Places Added per User:** measures the average number of new locations added by each user.

- **Number of Reviews per User:** evaluates how many restaurant and bar reviews are made, on average, by each user.

- **Average Time per Session:** indicates how long users stay browsing the app during each session.

### Monetization

Monetization metrics, as previously presented, were structured to monitor the platform's financial performance from its launch until its consolidation in the market.

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** represents the average amount spent to acquire a new user on the platform, considering expenses on marketing, sales, and advertising. This metric is crucial to evaluate the efficiency of acquisition campaigns and to ensure that the cost of acquiring a new customer is lower than the revenue generated by that customer over time.

- **ARPU (Average Revenue per User):** measures the average revenue generated per user in a given period, usually monthly. This metric is vital to understand the financial value each user brings to the platform and to project future revenue growth.

- **Number of Active Advertisers:** tracks the number of businesses and establishments using the platform to advertise their products and services. Having a solid base of advertisers is essential to consolidate a stable and diversified revenue stream.

- **Ad Conversion Rate:** measures the percentage of users who took a desired action (such as clicking or visiting an establishment) after being exposed to an advertisement. This metric directly reflects the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and the attractiveness of the target audience for advertisers.
