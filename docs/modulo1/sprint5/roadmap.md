# Roadmap

## Introduction

In the context of developing a new product, building a structured roadmap is essential to ensure organization, efficiency, and success. In this context, a clear and well-defined timeline not only allows for better allocation of resources and efforts over time but also provides visibility into progress, reduces risks, and facilitates strategic decision-making at critical moments. Additionally, dividing the project into modules and sprints promotes an iterative and incremental approach, ensuring continuous value delivery and increasing the ability to adapt as new information or changes in the environment arise. This roadmap was developed to guide the execution of the project through all its phases, from ideation to growth and market consolidation. Thus, the project plan was designed so that each module (10-week periods) has a defined focus, with deliverables established for each sprint (2-week periods) of the modules.

## Presentation of the Modules

The **first module** focuses on ideation, initial validation, and business plan development. The goal of this phase is to structure the strategic foundation of the project, deeply understanding the market, validating the opportunity, studying the competition, and designing the business model that will guide all subsequent phases. The attention here is on making well-informed decisions based on research and analysis, avoiding unfounded assumptions.

The **second module** is dedicated to the design and development of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). With the business model structured, this phase focuses on turning ideas into a concrete product. From requirement gathering to prototyping and technical development, this stage aims to build a functional first version of the platform that can be tested with real users, always prioritizing the quick and effective delivery of value.

In the **third module**, the focus shifts to validating the MVP and refining the product. With the initial MVP release, the priority is to listen to the market, gather qualified feedback, and iteratively improve the product. Based on the data and insights obtained, the project adjusts, resolves flaws, and prepares for a more robust launch, in addition to planning the go-to-market strategies and organizing the initial user acquisition campaigns.

Finally, the **fourth module** directs efforts towards scalability, growth, and tracking of metrics. The goal here is not only to optimize what has been built but also to drive organic and financial growth for the platform. Monetization tests, viralization strategies, data analysis, and dashboard construction will be key to ensuring the sustainable evolution of the project, culminating in the final presentation and defining the next steps for expansion.
