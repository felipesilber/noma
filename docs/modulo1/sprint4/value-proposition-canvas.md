# Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)

## Introduction

In the context of launching a new product in the market, mapping the elements that make this product attractive is an essential step for business success. However, this mapping process is not limited to creating a strong value proposition but also includes building a solid customer base and attracting investors, which are fundamental for the sustainability and scalability of the company. This exercise allows a clear understanding of what makes the product resonate with its target audience, validating its market relevance and ensuring that it is well received by consumers.

Regarding the acquisition of the first customers, this mapping is crucial as it helps identify the main needs and pains of consumers, enabling the company to develop an offer tailored to these demands. With a precise definition of the value proposition, it is possible to establish effective communication, highlighting the product’s unique benefits and encouraging early user adoption. On the other hand, attracting investors also requires a detailed analysis of the product’s attractiveness, especially in the current market context, where these financiers are more cautious and demanding, a shift from the pandemic era. According to a survey conducted by Valor Econômico in 2025, the venture capital environment indicates a slight unlocking of value and a gradual recovery of transactions, but with a priority on startups with **well-structured business models**. Thus, through this study, the company can build a compelling pitch, clearly demonstrating how its product solves a significant problem and how it can grow in the future.

## What is it?

The Value Proposition Canvas (VPC) is a strategic tool developed to help companies understand and accurately map the value their product or service offers to their target audience. Created by Alexander Osterwalder, the VPC aims to clearly align the benefits of an offer with the needs, desires, and expectations of consumers, enabling the company to develop more effective and appealing solutions for its market. In this context, it facilitates value proposition mapping through a visual and structured approach, divided into two main areas: Customer Profile and Value Map. By working with these two sections, companies can identify exactly how their solutions meet the audience’s needs and what aspects most attract their consumers.
