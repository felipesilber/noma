# TAM, SAM, SOM  

## **Introduction**
The **TAM, SAM, and SOM** framework is a powerful market analysis tool that helps businesses and startups estimate their potential audience and growth trajectory. It provides insights into how large the opportunity is, how much of it is realistically accessible, and what portion can be captured in the early years.

### **Understanding the Components:**
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Represents the total number of potential consumers for a product or service without any geographic or segmentation constraints.
- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**: Focuses on the segment of the TAM that is realistically reachable within a defined region or target demographic.
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: Represents the portion of the SAM that a company can realistically capture within its first few years of operation, considering competition, business capacity, and market penetration strategies.
